# Introduction
In this 90-minute workshop, you will learn how to use Oracle Machine Learning (OML) with Oracle Database 23c to analyze social media sentiment in real-time. This hands-on workshop will walk you through the entire process, from collecting social media data to building and evaluating a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. Attendees will gain experience with the latest OML features and understand how this technology can address the challenges of understanding public opinion on trending topics.
